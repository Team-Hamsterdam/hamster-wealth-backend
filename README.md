## About
- This Flask app is hosted on Heroku
- Hamster Wealth was built for the [Chronicle 2021 hackathon](http://chronicle2021.com/) hosted by the Google Developers Student Club @ University of Melbourne

## Tech Stack
- Python, Flask, SQLite3 (old database), PostgreSQL (new database)

## Inspiration
- We made Hamster Wealth in order to allow people to organise and manage their investments in an easy way. Most stock market portfolio tools online tend to be limited in certains ways such as requiring to use an associated broker, costing a fee to use or not supporting multiple markets. Hamster Wealth addresses these issues by being free to use, and by presenting users data from US markets in a simulated portfolio, allowing the user to experiment with risky investments without any payment to make it easier for people to get better at investing. Since the theme was Consumer Tech, we thought of software that we, as consumers, would use in our own lives and Hamster Wealth is what we came up with.

## What it does
- Hamster Wealth allows users to create virtual portfolios and simulate stock market conditions with actual stock market data which allows you to analyse positions and trades in multiple stocks.

## How we built it
- We first came up with the concept of the website and then created prototypes of the backend routes and functions which would be required for the app's functionality. Alongside this, we created visual mockups of the website design in order to decide on the interface design as well the colour scheme and general aesthetic of the website. With this foundation of planning we were able to simply work on the back end and front end of the website.

## Challenges we ran into
- Learning how to use our libraries and frameworks
- Running into unexpected bugs and errors that would take hours to fix
- Adjusting to changing requirements

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We learnt how to use different technologies and improved upon our technical skills
- We learnt how to use different APIs 

## What we learned
- The challenges involved in making a full stack application
- How to fix various rare bugs/errors

## What's next for Hamster Wealth
- Implementation of a leaderboard system possibly
- Implementation of multiple portfolios for each user
